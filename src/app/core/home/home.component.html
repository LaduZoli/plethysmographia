        <p class="lead">Plethysmography is a method that measures volume changes in <br> 
          a specific area or the entire body, typically by monitoring blood flow or respiration. <br>
           The term generally encompasses vascular plethysmography and peripheral <br>
           pulse plethysmography used by pulse oximeters. <br> <br>

          In vascular plethysmography, volume changes in blood vessels are measured using <br>
          a specialized sensor. This allows tracking of vascular abnormalities, <br>
          such as arterial spasms or hematoma. <br> <br>
          
          Peripheral pulse plethysmography is a method often applied to the fingertip or earlobe. <br> 
          The device tracks arterial pulses and can be used for monitoring pulse and oxygen levels.
